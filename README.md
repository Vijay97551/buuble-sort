# Bubble Sort

Bubble sort, also to as the sinking sort, is one of the simplest sorting algorithms that iterates through a given list, compares adjacent elements and swaps them if they are in the wrong order. A pass through the list is repeated until the list is completely sorted in the right order. The algorith requires one whole pass without any swap to verify if the list is actually sorted. This property can be used to optimize the bubble sort algorithm.
